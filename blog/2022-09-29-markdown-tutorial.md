# Why Everybody Should Master Markdown

- Can be used in slack/discord messages to quickly create code snippets and bold text;
- Can be used in writing content on collaboration tools like Notion/Trello/Asana;
- Can be used in notetaking apps like Boostnote and Obsidian;

#### Heading Level 4
##### Heading Level 5
###### Heading Level 6
```

```yaml remark
type: success
text: That nice code-block above is done by wrapping text in three backticks (```) before and after the code-block.
```

```
| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Some Info | Some Info 2 |
| More Info | More Info 2 |
| More Info | More Info 2 |
```
