# The Braicode Project

Welcome! I'm happy we're here to learn code together.

Code means, fundamentally, solve real world problems using different languages.
Coding is creation. When we start our programs things come to life and interact with each other, according to the rules that we, as their creator, define.

Have in mind that people learn things in different ways. 
There is no one true path or one-size-fits-all approach to learning programming. 
Try different things, and pay attention to what works well for you, what is the most fun to you, and keeps you motivated.
If you canâ€™t put a lot of time into it, then consider spending at least a few minutes on it every day. 
For example, every morning, before you leave the house, take 10 minutes to read a page in these tutorial, review an exercise, or read some code. 
Spend some time with it on your way to work.
Keep your subconscious mind busy with programming concepts.
Don't believe in all you read or see, try more then one source for the same topics.
